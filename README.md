Hi,

I'm Michael, creator and sole maintainer of Loudness.fm.

Unfortunately, I have to shut down the site.

All refunds will be processed by the end of August. Contact me at hey@loudness.fm if that's not the case. I will personally make sure  you get your refund.

Thank you for taking part in my journey. I'll always look back fondly on those late nights I spent building Loudness in college :) And I am grateful that I got to make something that helped so many people for a time.

With love,
Michael from Loudness
